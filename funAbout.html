<div id="funText">
I personally believe that being as open as possible about oneself can lead to more fulfilling relationships and collaborations. Thus, below includes some intersting and fun things which I'm interested in or tend to babble on about. If you want to learn more about me, feel free to peruse <a href="http://dphow.github.io/blog" target="_blank">my blog</a>. It's a new project of mine so bear with me if there's not much (if any) content yet.

<br><br>
<span style="font-size:2.25vmin"><strong>India and International Aspirations</strong></span><br>
I had the unique opportunity to travel to India the summer of 2015. First things first, <strong>travel abroad at any opportunity you get!</strong> Besides a very speedy high school chaperoned winds ensemble tour in Europe, I never had the luxury of travelling much anywhere growing up so going to India as my first experience was quite the culture shock. However, culture shock is only an issue if you let it be. I thoroughly enjoyed the different pace of life and being able to discover myself through another lense. Life can be more hectic in India, but a sense of urgency is gone compared to American life. It's hard to put to words what exactly changed in me because of India, but I can say that I will be eternally grateful to the country. So much so that now I've set my career path on various trajectories leading back to India, including researching monsoons and developing my skills in international relations amongst scientific and political communities. If you want to go to India and have interests in STEM or public health, ask me about the <a href="https://www.winstepforward.org/" target="_blank">S.N. Bose Scholars Program</a>.

<br><br>
<span style="font-size:2.25vmin"><strong>The Earth's Environment</strong></span><br>
I like to say that since an elementary field trip to a children's camp called Sunship Earth, I became particulary passionate about the Earth and the care we must take for the planet's common home. I further reinforced this passion through some of my involvements in undergrad such as through WE Conserve (now ended). Now I continue to set my priorities towards making sure the work I do addresses issues such as climate change and energy generation. Although I could easily enough just contribute my mathematical skills towards relevent problems, that is not enough. I believe that in order to truly make meaningful change, I must help instigate widespread cultural change. I alone can't solve the problems of the environment, so we need to come together to address and preserve the climate for our children and future generations. Just as was taught in Bill Cronon's course <a href="http://www.williamcronon.net/courses/460/" target="_blank">American Environmental History</a>, we must realize a bird's eye view of our lived environment, understand the interconnections we share not only with one another but also with the planet, and take up the moral responsibility we have as stewards of the Earth. I find the course's <a href="https://youtu.be/LLL9Cugf4i8?t=31s" target="_blank">final lecture</a> particularly moving.
<br><br>
P.S. Be sure to also read Cronon's "<a href="http://www.williamcronon.net/writing/cronon_only_connect.pdf" target="_blank">Only Connect... The Goals of a Liberal Education</a>."
<br><br>

<span style="font-size:2.25vmin"><strong>Music</strong></span><br>
I come from a family of musicians so music continues to be very important in my life. Growing up, I started violin at age 5 and added viola and French horn later. I've also sang since I could stand. Currently, I play either violin or horn in the <a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~symphony/" target="_blank">Notre Dame Symphonic Orchestra</a> and also sing baritone in the <a href="https://www.southbendchambersingers.org/" target="_blank">South Bend Chamber Singers</a>.
<br><br>
Although my background and training is in classical music, over the years I've come to appreciate a wide variety of music. An established string standard and favorite of mine is Barber's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KylMqxLzNGo" target="_blank">Adagio for Strings</a>. Without fail, I get goosebumps everytime at the piece's climax at 6:09 in this performance. In addition to this classic, I also hold fondness for Albinoni's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMbvcp480Y4" target="_blank">Adagio in G Minor</a> since it reminds me of my father, who passed from Lou Gherig's disease (ALS) back in 2000 and had this played at his funeral. Beyond this, I've come to appreciate quite a few modern orchestral works, which are often found in video games and movie soundtracks. Many of these modern compositions are often underapreciated publicly, but I will share a few of my favorites:
<br><br>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2lwFiIaMAE&list=PL8DDD2D047A076DC8" target="_blank">Nier Soundtrack</a> - Many are excellent and a unique listen including 
	"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgMRNiEPPYg" target="_blank">Grandma</a>" and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x0-EYfwP-c" target="_blank">Emil Sacrifice</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4aRbiTMBUE" target="_blank">Karma</a>"</li>
	<li>Bioshock Infinite "<a href="https://youtu.be/6GiKRkH5iH8?t=1m29s" target="_blank">Will the Circle Be Unbroken</a>" - Given the 1910s setting, the music fully realizes the character of the game's city.</li>
	<li>Civilization IV "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJiHDmyhE1A" target="_blank">Baba Yetu</a>" - The first video game piece to earn a grammy award and is the Swahili version of the Lord's Prayer.</li>
	<li>Journey "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypNgvc6c6Cc" target="_blank">Apotheosis</a>" - With an excellent soundtrack, this atypical game redefines what players can experience in games. Composer Austin Wintory is amazing.</li>
	<li>Okami "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRx9gnY0Mp0" target="_blank">Reset</a>" - A curious mixing of modern style with traditional Japanese instruments.</li>
	<li>Everybody's Gone to the Rapture "<a href="https://youtu.be/zdwpwGkokQk?t=59m25s" target="_blank">The Pattern Calls Out</a>" - Really shouldn't choose just one piece. The whole soundtrack is surreal and features eerie vocals with emotive instrumentals.</li>
	<li>Final Fantasy XIII "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdgF63xKTe0" target="_blank">Fang's Theme</a>" - I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan and enjoy Uematsu-san's and Shimomura-san's music of many Square Enix games. Much of the music across the series (and Kingdom Hearts) is excellent, but I particularly like this one for it's epic horn calls.</li>
	<li>Legend of Zelda "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkYSuWSPkHI" target="_blank">Main Theme Medley</a>" - Koji Kondo does a great job creating memorable melodies, but even without nostalgia, this medley is well orchestrated.</li>
</ul>
<br>
As you might guess, I don't follow the typical pop music artists of today. However, one band that I intensely enjoy is Walk the Moon. "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDVW81bXo0s" target="_blank">Anna Sun</a>" became the anthem of my freshman year of college in 2011 and songs like "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww7RNf2R14U" target="_blank">Different Colors</a>" help me be excited towards the pursuit of unity in diversity. I really do believe that we achieve greater accomplishments when we come together across our differences. Music can help be the bridge.

<br><br>
<span style="font-size:2.25vmin"><strong>Movies, TV, Video Games, and Anime</strong></span><br>
Actually, I don't watch too much television. But when I do, I have a few favorites. The first movie that comes to mind is "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWnAqFyaQ5s" target="_blank">Cloud Atlas</a>" while for TV "<a href="https://www.hulu.com/rick-and-morty" target="_blank">Rick and Morty</a>" wins for sure. Given these examples, I typically enjoy thought provoking films with philosophical ideations, where a certain humor and wit can be certainly appreciated. One of the shows I grew up with as a kid "<a href="http://www.nick.com/avatar-the-last-airbender/" target="_blank">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>" has plenty of complex themes (racism, political intrigue, spirituality) for those who watch it as adults. Of course, I'll also jump on the "<a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones" target="_blank">Games of Thrones</a>" bandwagon but have recently taken to "<a href="http://www.hbo.com/westworld" target="_blank">Westworld</a>." Such a cool way to discover yourself in a theme park.
<br><br>
Video games also take up too much time in my life but they allow me to reflect and help me, at least in virtual reality first, press on towards the impossible goals I have for myself. I have fond nostalgia for games from the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy" target="_blank">Final Fantasy</a>" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts" target="_blank">Kingdom Hearts</a>" series. "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X" target="_blank">Final Fantasy X</a>" can be analyzed as a "<a href="http://ontologicalgeek.com/change-or-live-final-fantasy-x-as-catholic-dystopia/" target="_blank">Catholic Dystopia</a>" which I attribute somewhat to me becoming agnostic. Through the recent "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XV" target="_blank">Final Fantasy XV</a>" I contemplated on the sacrifices we all must put forth in order to serve others. Prince Noctis gives up so much along his journey in the game (If admittedly a disjointed story of a game). I usually look for an overall message in the media I consume, so in this case I took to heart that I must be willing to endure sacrifice on my pursuit towards a PhD if I am to eventually give back something worthwhile to society. My more western tastes take form in games like "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock_(series)" target="_blank">Bioshock</a>" when I want a finely crafted story or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(series)" target="_blank">Portal</a>" when I want mind-bending puzzles. Artful games like "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus" target="_blank">Shadow of the Collosus</a>," "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game)" target="_blank">Journey</a>," and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Strange" target="_blank">Life is Strange</a>" should also not go unnoticed. 
<br><br>
As you might guess with my liking of Japanese RPGs, I also binge the occasional anime movie or series. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli" target="_blank">Studio Ghibli</a> films are my jam (these films are much better for children compared to Disney). My favorite, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OiMOHRDs14" target="_blank">Princess Mononoke</a>," exhibits a refined balance between spirituality, fantasy, and respect for the Earth. Other good films include "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SlB-SpDMKI" target="_blank">Wolf Children</a>," a honest fantastical story on parenthood, and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU47nhruN-Q" target="_blank">Your Name</a>" which highlights the base interconnections we sense with others. I'll also mention "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7ZdjqWBiuw" target="_blank">Arashi no Yoru ni</a>." My absolute favorite series is "<a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/kids-on-the-slope" target="_blank">Kids on the Slope</a>" which features an eclectic group of high schoolers navigiating adolescence with Jazz (the high school thing is an overdone trope, but I suppose it continues to work). Other series I've watched include "<a href="https://www.hulu.com/death-note" target="_blank">Deathnote</a>," "<a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/psycho-pass" target="_blank">Psycho-Pass</a>," "<a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/attack-on-titan" target="_blank">Attack on Titan</a>," and a personal recommendation from a math professor "<a href="https://www.hulu.com/elfen-lied" target="_blank">Elfen Lied</a>."

<br><br>
<span style="font-size:2.25vmin"><strong>Rock Climbing and Hiking</strong></span><br>
I grew up in flatland Midwest Indiana where the local Potato Creek State Park "boasts" its highest elevation at 883 feet. This is an absolute height measurement, so when you compare to the surroundings, it is actually just a little hump in the middle of some woods. Clearly, my Hoosier origin has never offered any real climbing opportunities. However, I'm thankful to my brother who through his own interest in rock climbing got our whole family to go on trips to Red River Gorge in Kentucky and Devil's Lake in Wisconsin. That and rope swings attached to 60 foot trees from the second story roof of our home! He planted the seed that built my interest in rock climbing and outdoor adventures. Unfortunately, for far too long I've let the work of school and other obligations hold me back from pursuing rock climbing as much as I'd like.
<br><br>
This coming year, I hope to force myself to focus on my own wants and needs more as opposed to those expectations set by others. Thus, if you're reading this, please allow and encourage me to actually make time to go rock climbing and travel to good spots across the US. Right now, I can't wait for the new climbing wall to be finished at Notre Dame, but in the meantime I hope to convince some friends to go on more climbinig outings.

<br><br>
<span style="font-size:2.25vmin"><strong>Electronic Dance Music</strong></span><br>
As for something completely different from my classical interests, it's a clichéd genre but to me it fills me with optimism, encourages unity with others, and helps motivate me to keep going and not give up. For many this ends up as a workout routine, but EDM helps me endure an arduous PhD program requiring exceptional self-discipline. Plus, I thoroughly enjoy being a part of something greater than myself. When I'm at massive music festivals, I'm consistently mystified by the thousands of people who so easily come together as one collective group, all enjoying not only the music but the experience of acting as one with so many supportive and happy strangers around them. The songs clearly help bring out this unity inherent to our humanness, but in addition, many song's lyrics encourage listeners to confront their emotions or take risks and seek adventure, all of which I want to do more of. I'll admit that a lot of EDM is only for a consistent predictable beat you can dance to, yet some artists go beyond this formulaic approach and begin to crack the shell of the human experience. If you look at the history of EDM, the <a href="http://www.jmcacademy.edu.au/news/the-history-of-edm" target="_blank">genre's roots</a> were actually to integrate unexplored styles and electronic techniques into musical expression. My favorite artists are the ones that take these risks while at the same time freely injecting themselves and their personality into the artform. Hands down Madeon and Porter Robinson are my favorites, who produce primarily melodic EDM.
<br><br>
Madeon's album "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOpxqCIvscU" target="_blank">Adventure</a>" has actually been permanently associated in my mind with happy memories since when, like Pavlov's Dog, I trained my ears to this album during my first travels to India (I say first bacause I plan to go again). Now, I can't help but be filled with a sense of adventure and smile whenever I hear "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqUBmeFn7qM" target="_blank">The City</a>" and other Madeon compositions. In my mind, The City refers to the grandeur of Bangalore, a place I continue to dream of.
<br><br>
Porter's second album "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si81bIoZRJQ&list=PLAZNU5fM7FIAndWHF8KXqy5wJzG1D5pkF" target="_blank">Worlds</a>" exhibits his personality a lot more freely without the confines of the EDM genre's expectations. It goes through a wide variety of emotions and stories to tell. "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0" target="_blank">Shelter</a>" which through a unique anime production tells the story of a young girl living in a virtual reality world created by her father. "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrZz2uTWNWQ" target="_blank">Sad Machine</a>" (also a collaboration with Madeon's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGCnoVrgf9c" target="_blank">You're On</a>") makes me realize the importance of others around me and that as much as we may depend on you, you also depend on us. "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSooYPG-5Rg" target="_blank">Sea of Voices</a>" (and the same featuring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T1gZl9Pib8" target="_blank">Charlie Chaplin's speech</a>) reminds me to see the beauty in this world and others. Our universe exists as a creation in our mind's eye which, if we realize this, can actually be made undone to any level of understanding we desire. We can learn so much from eachother and our own existence. Overall, music works its magic by letting the listener find themselves in the art so I hope you take the time to do that. Feel free to let me know what you think, but if you want to spoil it, there's an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/porterrobinson/comments/34ei48/the_story_of_worlds_according_to_some_of_my/" target="_blank">interesting story</a> that's said to encompass the whole Worlds album.

<br><br>
<span style="font-size:2.25vmin"><strong>Friends</strong></span><br>
And for those who've actually read this far, thank you! Although I've often make myself too busy, can be a hermit sometimes, and may spend little time spending time with and supporting you, my friends mean the world to me. Please continue encouraging me to do crazy things with you. I really do depend on you even if only in spirit or memories when we are so far away. If there is any way I can better help you or you have an idea to help me, please reach out and let me know. Be sure to also hold me accountable to my promises, I know I mess up sometimes. Over the years I've experienced the greatest joys by serving others. Thus, when you help me improve myself, especially in regards to the needs of my friends, that is when I am happiest.
<br><br>
Thanks again. Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.
